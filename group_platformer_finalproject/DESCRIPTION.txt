The game is asking players to collect or avoid something in order to survive and get to the next level. The mushroom, coin and gem are helping the player to restore their health and earn more points. However, bomb, laser and spiders are having negative effects on the player's health and points. In each level, the player must collect the key and go to the door in order to go to the next level. Whenever the player collects something, some music will be played, and when the player lose a life, a ghost will raise from its position. Also, the player can mute the music in the game by clicking the music button on the top right.
